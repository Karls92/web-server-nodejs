# web-server-nodejs

This is a demo of how to create a simple web server with NodeJS without using the ExpressJS framework.

If you are practicing NodeJS and want to experiment with the http module to create and analyze the operation of a web server with NodeJS, or if you want to learn how to create a simple web server with nodejs, this code can be useful.

In this repo, you can find two files:

1. The app.js file: contains all the code needed to start the server.
2. The index.html file: it's a simple html document that is loaded when the server starts.

If you want to use this code: 

a. Download this repository.

b. Unzip it into a folder.

c. From the command console of your computer, go to the root directory where the two files are, and execute the command "node app.js".
Immediately the server will start.
